# IPL Best 11 Players Analysis

This is a python project that uses historical data of Indian Premier League (IPL) players to analyze and evaluate their past performances. The project uses web scraping techniques to gather data from various sources and then filters and cleans the data for analysis. Various data visualization and statistical techniques are used to analyze the players' statistics. Based on the analysis, a team of the best 11 players is selected and assembled. The project uses the following python libraries:

- BeautifulSoup for web scraping(but here for the sake of simplicity we use an online platform - brightdata)
- Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

The project can be useful for cricket enthusiasts or fantasy cricket players to make informed decisions about their team selection. The final output of the project will be a team of best 11 players based on their past performance.
